Looking forward to joining public meetings across Rajasthan today 
Saw great vigour & vibrancy among people of Rajasthan during the public meetings I addressed today. Change is coming in the state!
Urged people to make BJP victorious & take Rajasthan to greater heights under Vasundhara ji 
Great being in MP today. Joined 4 public meetings. Urged people to vote for BJP's performance over failed promises & corruption of Congress.
These elections are between development agenda & votebank politics. People are angry with Congress & want to punish it.
Congress keeps mocking the poor. For us poor are manifestation of God. A person may be born poor but we must work to ensure no one dies poor
Congress makes grand promises in poll bound states but why can't they implement the same promises in states they govern? Why mislead people?
People of MP consider @ChouhanShivraj a part of their family. He & lakhs of our Karyakartas are devoted to serving MP 
"In Agra, I said that BJP is driven by the principle of integration & would bring development that would touch every section of society."
"Instead of misquoting Atal ji, shouldn't PM speak about Congress VP's statement on his Government & how it lowered dignity of PM's office?"
A 'Gyaani' UPA Minister says prices are rising because poor are now eating 2 sabzis. Is this what they think of the poor? Why such mockery!
"Urged people to start voting early, vote for the Lotus & give BJP a chance to serve them once again"
"Tomorrow I will address rallies in Mandsaur, Ujjain & Delhi "
Many friends are asking about my campaign schedule. Sharing schedule for the coming 3 days

These elections are not only to elect your MLA. They will determine MP's future! Support BJP & continue MP's progress 
"Going to Delhi, where I look forward to interacting with people at a rally in Dwarka"
Elections in our national capital are very important. Urged people to support BJP so that Delhi gets the governance it deserves.
"They think India is a beehive. For us, India is our Mother. For them poverty is a joke but it causes pain & anguish in our hearts."
Congress believes in Vanshvaad & saving their chairs. We are guided by Rashtravaad & work towards saving the nation 
"Dr. Harsh Vardhan called for uprooting the Congress, which has misled the people of Delhi for 15 years with empty promises @drharshvardhan"

In Rajasthan today. Addressed a public meeting in Khetri. Thankful to people who joined. 
Khetri was a very important place in Swami Vivekananda's life. He came to Khetri as Narendra but left it as Vivekananda.
In Khetri I spent some time at the place where Swami Vivekananda stayed. It was really wonderful being there. Felt blessed.
Urged people of Rajasthan to uproot Congress in every part of the state & make BJP win in every polling booth 
I join my fellow countrymen in remembering all those who lost their lives in the cowardly terror attacks in Mumbai on 26th November 2008.
"Due to 26/11 attacks we lost our heroes who put duty before self, who sacrificed themselves for the nation. Salute to them!"
26/11 is a grim reminder of the security threat India faces. Best tribute to the victims is to ensure that such attacks never happen again.
Centre's failure to bring the real perpetrators of 26/11 to justice is disappointing. It is high time Centre acts decisively.
Let us assure families of the victims that sacrifice of their near ones will not go in vain. Time to work towards a stronger & safer India.
Met a delegation from Italy led by the Italian Ambassador to India 
"""Told Home Minister on local mole...suggested matter be pursued..don't know what happened to that."" Will UPA explain? "
Madam asks where was Rajasthan's Opposition for 5 years. The Opposition & the people were trying to locate the Government with a microscope!
Congress does not want to answer people of Rajasthan but people will give a befitting answer for Congress' misdeeds 
Vikas mantra has woken up Rae Bareli! Good to see development agenda take precedence over everything else 
"It is unfortunate that in giving 'lessons' to me, the Finance Minister has to resort to lies. "

Jaitley ji has brought out the discriminatory attitude in J&K...said this has no place in Law 
"It is said about J&K- if there is heaven on earth, it is here. We all need to work to make J&K a heaven of peace, integration & diversity."

We have seen yet another successful demonstration of the strength of our democracy over the past few weeks. Congrats to the Indian voter!
Biggest achievement has been the extensive voter outreach. Glad to see so many young voters coming out to vote.
An important dimension on Article 370 has been shared by Shri Arun Jaitley in his latest post. It is a must read 
"Communal Violence Bill is ill-conceived, poorly drafted & a recipe for disaster! My letter to PM opposing this Bill "
Timing of Communal Violence Bill is suspicious. Political considerations & votebank politics rather than genuine concerns are guiding it.
Communal Violence Bill is in clear violation of India's federal structure. Centre is busy forming laws on matters that are in the State List
"If implemented, Communal Violence Bill would fragment society & increase violence. It will have results opposite of the stated objective."
Welcoming my Party colleague Shri Arun Jaitley to Twitter! @arunjaitley
RIP Nelson Mandela. The world has lost an apostle of peace & non-violence who redefined the journey of his nation for the good of humankind.

Congrats to @ChouhanShivraj @VasundharaBJP @drramansingh & @drharshvardhan & their teams for efforts that ensured BJP's great performance
The total number of seats Congress has won in all the four states today cannot even match the seats @BJP4India won in 1 state!
Spoke to Raman Singh ji & congratulated him on BJP's well deserved victory in Chhattisgarh. Thanks to people for reposing faith in BJP again
"The Final Tally- BJP has won 408 out of 589 seats, which is near 70% of the total seats. Phenomenal! Congress shrunk - only 21% of seats."
This is a wonderful beginning towards success in our Mission272+ and for fulfilling the dream of a Congress Mukt Bharat.

Feeling extremely blessed after spending the day in the land of Lord Vishwanath. The atmosphere at the rally was phenomenal.
"Condition of Ganga is pitiable. For others, Ganga may be a river but for us Ganga is our Mother. Ganga is an integral part of our culture."
"When elections come Congress chants 'poor poor' but forgets that if someone is responsible for India's poverty, it is Congress & 1 family."
Glad that the enthusiasm for the rally in Varanasi was as much on social media as it was on the ground
"It was Mumbai that gave the call of 'Quit India' to the British. Today, urged people to give a clarion call for a Congress Mukt Bharat!"
"BJP believes in politics of development. People's welfare is not possible without development. For us, every poor person of India is a VIP."

"Freedom from dynasty politics, nepotism, corruption, communalism, divisions in society, poverty...this is what Congress Mukt Bharat is."
It is unfortunate that the Home Minister makes statements that violate India's federal structure & are loaded with votebank politics

There couldn't have been a better way to mark 51 yrs of 'Ae Mere Vatan Ke Logon' than witnessing Lata Didi sing parts of the historic song!
Our Armed Forces don't only shine on the battlefield! We have seen their great service in saving lives be it in Uttarakhand or Kutch quake.
India needs to be self-reliant in manufacturing defence equipment. Till when will we keep importing arms from overseas?
A very touching part of the evening was when everyone sung 'Ae Mere Vatan Ke Logon' at the end of the programme

Addressed a massive public meeting in Chennai. Thankful to people & representatives from other political parties who attended the rally.
Spoke about the plight of the fishermen from Tamil Nadu. Centre's apathy towards them indicates UPA's lack of concern for the poor.
A noble nation like ours is being troubled by our neighbours while the Centre stands helplessly. We need a strong government to change this.
Language & arrogance of Congress leaders & Ministers is deeply unfortunate. People know who is fooling them & will not tolerate Congress now
The Recounting Minister keeps abusing others but the nation demands answers on the rampant mismanagement of the economy during his tenure.
"Urged students to make India a hub of innovation where our youth create the next Apple, Google & Microsoft "

Communists do not believe in democracy. They know people of India will never accept them so they keep taking about Third Front before polls.
Kerala is called 'God's Own Country' but why are youngsters leaving in search of jobs? Centre & State Govts have failed to create jobs.
Kerala has seen misrule of UDF & LDF. Kerala now needs an alternative for development & that alternative is BJP

5 types of technologies will be used to organise #ChaiPeCharcha. I am sure it will be a memorable interaction & a great learning experience.
It was a delight to answer questions from people across the length & breadth of India over a cup of tea during Chai Pe Charcha!
"Chai Pe Charcha took me down the memory lane,when I sold tea. It reminded me of my experiences & interactions with different types of people"
Chai Pe Charcha took the discussion to where it matters- among the people. It was great hearing ideas of our youth 
I could sense the strong urge for good governance among the people. We need to bridge the trust deficit & work towards a developed India!
Perfect blend of tea & technology made Chai Pe Charcha memorable. Looking forward to such Charchas in the coming days

PM says money doesn't grow on trees but HP CM's assets grew 14 times in 3 years  & he says it was due to apple trees! Can we trust Congress?
"NDA will form the next government & our agenda is National Development Alliance, committed to development of India "
UPA's last vote-on-account is extremely disappointing! It is nothing but a glorified exercise in self-congratulation.
FM says 296 projects worth Rs. 6.6 lakh crore cleared recently. Why were these projects held back at all? Is it not policy paralysis?
"While the FM may pat his own back, the fact remains that our youth is bearing the brunt of rising unemployment "
"FM eats up plan exp, rolls over Rs 35,000 cr subsidies to next yr to contain fiscal deficit even as non-plan exp overshoots! Real hard work!"
Hard working' Finance Minister also joins other illustrious UPA ministers who are seeking refuge in history to judge their 'performance.'
It is upto the people to decide whether the Economist PM & FM have been 'hard working' or 'hardly working' in their tenure.
"I welcome the decision on 'One Rank, One Pension' for our servicemen. Belated wisdom finally dawns on our 'hard working' UPA ministers."
The only solace one gets from the vote-on-account is that this was UPA's final act of misery after a decade of decay & policy paralysis.
Centre's refusal to allow gates on Narmada Dam is unfortunate. Why play politics over Narmada Mata?
For the next few weeks @yogrishiramdev will conduct Yoga Shivirs across Gujarat. Am sure people will benefit immensely from these camps.

"To hide their failures, they hide under garb of secularism. They say, ""forget jobs, water shortage,price rise...secularism is under threat!"""
"Their secularism is about votebank politics but for us it means India First. For them its an empty slogan, for us its an article of faith."

"Let us act immediately! Today, let us all become volunteers for EC & make our democracy stronger, vibrant & more participative."
In Bihar today. Will join Hunkar Rally in Purnia 
Its important to understand true nature of 3rd Front- these are parties that have supported & saved Congress & consist of dozen PM hopefuls.
3rd front leaders are silent when people face crisis & soldiers are beheaded. They rise before elections & go back to sleep till next polls.
Such is corruption of Congress that the cows of Bihar are worried about what will happen to the fodder if Congress & its ally win elections.
"Our secularism is to take every section of society together, not leave them impoverished & keep them as votebanks for petty political gains."
NDA is going to people with assurance of providing a progress oriented & stable govt. to fulfil dreams of our youth

Paid my respects to every martyr who died defending the nation & recalled the courage of our Kashmiri Pandit sisters & brothers.
Give us 60 months to serve you. We don't want to enjoy power but want to be Chowkidars who will guard people's money http://nm4.in/1jH3boo 
"At Delhi's Bharat Vijay Rally, urged people of Delhi to decide on the basis of their recent experiences & elect all 7 BJP candidates."
A Dalit won Vadodara Cong Primary but was asked to withdraw overnight. Shows Cong's lack of respect even for systems they themselves created
Manifestos are sacrosanct but today's Cong manifesto was a joke! It repeated all the promises they haven't been able to fulfil since 2004.
People can forgive mistakes but not betrayals. There is no place for betrayals & betrayers in Delhi
"Despite Maoists giving a call not to come to the rally, there was record attendance! It shows the victory of democracy over the gun"
"India must be coloured with colours of progress, not colour of blood. Maoists should not have guns but ploughs & pens in their hands."
Addressed rallies in Sasaram & Gaya in Bihar. Here is a glimpse of the rally in Gaya 
"Its clear that people are tired of Congress' empty promises. Time of only Acts has gone. People want Action & development, not mere slogans."
"Track record of UPA speaks for itself- they have taken India backwards! What happened to their claims of reducing prices, creating jobs?"
Nobody believes Congress when they say they will end corruption & bring back black money. Did they bring even a single Rupee back in 10 yrs?
"Centre, Bihar Govt. & those who returned from jail must answer- why the delay in Kutku Dam? Crores have been spent but nothing has happened"
"Addressed rallies in Mandla & Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Seeing immense enthusiasm for BJP among people "
"Due to efforts of @ChouhanShivraj & his team, MP's image as a BIMARU state has changed & the state is scaling newer heights of development."
"While BJP Govts. are working tirelessly for welfare of Tribal communities, Cong treats them as votebanks & remembers them only during polls."
"Assured the people that NDA will give a development oriented Govt. If a Rupee leaves Delhi, every single Paisa will reach the people."
We salute the brave officers who lost their lives in the unfortunate C-130 J crash. Condolences to the bereaved families.
I pray for the speedy recovery & good health of Union Minister Shri Manish Tewari.
"Spoke at a large rally in Gohana, Haryana. Mood across Western UP & Haryana is clear- people want development, not divisive politics."
"Shahzada says Modi is an ideology. I am proud to belong to an ideology where Nation is bigger than Party, where serving India is paramount."
"People want opportunities, not opportunism. Youngsters want skills, they are not interested in communalism "
"Addressing NRIs in Jan, PM had said bad days are over, good days are coming. He is right- UPA is a burden for India & people will reject UPA"
NDA stands for good governance that benefits all sections of society. We will ensure that youth get quality education & ample opportunities.
"With their names appearing in CWG & Adarsh Scams, Maharashtra Cong-NCP leaders are disrespecting Shivaji Maharaj's legacy of good governance"
Best tribute to respected Balasaheb Thackeray would be to fulfill his dream of Congress-NCP free Maharashtra & India 
Nanded has won me over! Thanks to the people for turning out in record numbers. Great rally 
Urged people of Nanded to defeat the 'Adarsh candidate' of Congress who has played with emotions of widows of Kargil martyrs.
Adarsh is not only about corruption & allotting flats to relatives. Adarsh shows lack of respect Congress has towards our brave armed forces
Shahzada says he wont compromise on corruption & there will be investigation on Adarsh...is giving the Nanded Ticket 'investigation'?
Why is Cong hesitant to bring back black money? Because they know who it belongs to...NDA will bring back every Paisa that is stashed abroad
"This is an Election to elect a new Parliament but sadly, some Congress leaders keep talking about Gujarat as if its a Gujarat election. Why?"
"If it took 60yrs for Cong to create 'Infrastructure Map' in their mind, it will take 600yrs for them to execute it. India cant wait so long!"
NDA is committed to a policy-driven Govt. with strong systems in place to check corruption. We can not compromise with future of our youth.
"Demography, Democracy & Demand...the 3 Ds are India's strength! No other nation is blessed with all 3 the way we are "

Here is a glimpse of the rally in Arunachal Pradesh. Really grateful to the people for their overwhelming support 
A loud & clear NO?this was the answer I got when I asked whether youngsters in Northeast got jobs & whether prices reduced in last decade
Italian marines mercilessly killed our fishermen. If Madam is so 'patriotic' can she tell us in which jail are the marines lodged in?
2014 polls are not about arithmetic but people's chemistry with BJP. In arithmetic 1+1 is 2 but such is our chemistry that 1 & 1 becomes 11!
"People of Assam should reject those who have forgotten them & bless NDA, which is committed to Assam's progress "
Greetings on Cheti Chand. May Lord Jhulelal bless our lives with joy and good health.

" On Utkal Diwas, I extend my greetings to sisters & brothers of Odisha."
"Thankful to people of Bareilly for joining the Rally in large numbers, braving the scorching heat "
For Congress all 365 days are April Fools' Day. They mislead people & remember poor only before elections. Such a Party must be punished.
Congress said we will crush Modi...then they said BJP wont get allies. Picture from Kashmir to Kanyakumari suggests otherwise!
"Congress, SP & BSP know they wont win so they are spreading bogey of instability. Instability is the last thing India needs at the moment."
In MP I don't need to talk about development agenda of BJP. They are already seeing the great work of MP Govt. under @ChouhanShivraj
"2014 is not about BJP or Modi. Its about giving India a strong, stable & inclusive Govt, which only NDA can provide "
"For us, Nation comes above everything else. We will give our lives for people. Bless NDA for India's growth "

"For us, secularism is to unite & work for the nation. For Congress, secularism is 'Religion First' but for us it is 'India First.'"
India needs to break free from Cong's divisive mindset & take every section of society together for India's progress 
Shahzada should tell us who are the magicians who took land of farmers & became rich overnight. How is he related to such people?
Places like Kurukshetra have the potential to draw tourists from all over India but neither Centre nor Haryana Govt. have worked on this.
No NDA state figures in list of top 10 states with high crime rate against women while 7 Congress ruled states figure in the list.

"Just as the first rays of the Sun fall on Northeast, I am confident that the first rays of Mission 272's success will emerge from Northeast."
India will develop only when Northeast develops! Sharing my recent speeches in the Northeast 
Why did Union Power Minister cancel a programme to award top performing power companies? Because Gujarat power companies won top awards!
"We are proud of governance of @ChouhanShivraj. He has done more for roads, power & water in MP than any preceding Congress Govt. in 50 yrs."
"When farmers suffered due to hail storms, it was @ChouhanShivraj who rushed to help them. Congress & its leaders were totally indifferent."
Congress' 1 point programme is to facilitate the Son Rise in Delhi. The Nation is secondary?only the Son's career must be safe. Very sad.
Congratulations on Vijay Sankalp Diwas. I bow to lakhs of Karyakartas who have selflessly devoted themselves to build BJP over the years
"Today BJP has emerged as a ray of hope for every Indian, who sees BJP as the harbinger of providing strong, stable & inclusive governance."
"On Vijay Sankalp Diwas, looking forward to addressing Karyakartas from over 6 lakh polling booths this evening "
"Congress, SP & BSP are one. They pretend to fight in Lucknow but in Delhi they are friends. Its like those orchestrated wrestling matches."
Those doing votebank politics prefer to keep society poor. They are not committed to development & service. Such parties must be defeated.
On 9th I will file my nomination papers for Vadodara Lok Sabha seat. Going to meet Atal ji at his residence to seek his blessings.
5 seats in Assam & 1 seat in Tripura vote today. Urging voters in these 6 seats to turnout in large numbers & cast their votes.
"#BJPManifesto - a futuristic & inclusive manifesto that will take India ahead, creating 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat.'"
#BJPManifesto- for us manifesto is not a ritual or formality. The Manifesto encapsulates our Disha & Lakshya towards a developed India.
We are going to people with Mantra of good governance & development. We assure you a Govt. that thinks & works for the poor. #BJPManifesto
NDA is committed to providing a strong Govt. where we can walk with our heads held high at the global level & every nation respects us.
I congratulate Dr. Joshi & his team. I also congratulate other well wishers who have given inputs in creating such a comprehensive manifesto
"I urge you to read the #BJPManifesto, share it with friends and family and join us in this journey to Transform India "
#BJPManifesto has what it takes to get India running after a decade of policy paralysis & fulfil dreams of people 
Narcotics & lots of fake currecny is entering through our borders But Centre is watching silently & helplessly. Why?

"We salute brave CRPF personnel martyred in Aurangabad, Bihar. We stand by their families in this hour of grief. Prayers with the injured."
UPA is more interested in Defence Deals rather than Defence Power & this explains why we are facing so many problems today.
Congress is like a watermelon- green outside but red from within. Time to reject such a Party across the nation http
"NDA brought the IT Act. Software export growth during NDA time was 40%, it has fallen to 9%...and Shahzada says Cong brought IT revolution"
Congress? situation is so bad that they have put a candidate worth thousands of crores in Bengaluru...but he has no Aadhaar!
"On Aadhaar, neither the Team that I met nor PM could answer my Qs on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick"
People are asking what happened to the thousands of crores that have been allotted to schemes like NREGA. Why are youngsters still jobless?
On my way to Vadodara to file my nomination papers 
"Congress leaders specialise in poverty tourism. With cameras, they go to villages, sit with the poor, eat their food & get pictures clicked."
"From Tandoor Case to recent Latur Case, Congress' 'commitment' to safety & dignity of women is evident. Nothing has changed in so many years"
"When a Govt. is immersed in Parivar Bhakti instead of Desh Bhakti, result is a weak Govt. in Delhi due to which every neighbour troubles us."
NDA is committed to fulfilling Atal ji's dream of river linking so that Maharashtra's farmers don't have to suffer 
"All those voting today in 91 Lok Sabha seats, 70 seats for Odisha Vidhan Sabha & by-election in Maharashtra should vote in record numbers"

"We have seen misrule of UPA, Left & 'Nakli Poriborton'. Time to support NDA for 'Asli Poriborton' in Bengal & India "
India doesn't fear 'magicians' but it fears 'Black Magic' of last decade that has destroyed opportunities for people 
High voter turnout in today's polls is very encouraging. I congratulate & thank people. Hope the positive trend continues in later phases.
Addressed 3 rallies in Bihar. Here is a glimpse of the rally in Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat
"Urging friends in Mizoram to vote in record numbers in the Lok Sabha election, which is being held in the state today."

Will appear on 'Aap Ki Adalat' with @RajatSharmaLive this evening. Watch it at 10 PM on @indiatvnews
Shahzada came to Rajasthan without informing their CM & rode on a bike belonging to a history sheeter. Perhaps he was inspired by Dhoom 3
Give us over 300 seats & we assure you a strong & stable Govt. that will make India a stronger & developed nation 
Dadasaheb Phalke award to Gulzar Sahab is a fitting tribute for his rich contribution to India cinema. My congratulations to him.
"Yesterday I read that a book has come out, written by a close aide of PM & it spills the beans on why things were ruined in last decade."
In last 10 years we saw such a severe Accident that the entire nation has been ruined! UPA has not maintained sanctity of the office of PM.
"Poor say we are hungry,Shahzada says we gave you Acts. People say we want education, he says we gave Acts. What kind of a mean joke is this?"
Congress must come clean on the serious allegations of undeclared foreign bank accounts of their Amritsar candidate & his family members.
If Cong cant tell truth about their own former CM how can we trust them? The Govt. after 16th May will place everything in front of people.
"Don't forget to watch ""Aap Ki Adalat"" with @RajatSharmaLive on @indiatvnews. The Adalat convenes in a few minutes at 10 PM."
Several people were injured in the mishap. A young girl is still lying unconscious in a private hospital. Wish her a speedy recovery.
It was disturbing to know that the injured did not get timely medical attention & authorities showed no concern when mishap took place
"I have always urged Maoists to leave the bullet, join the mainstream & work towards nation building. Sadly their cowardly acts continue."

NDA is firm on its commitment to create a corruption free India so that best opportunities are created for our youth 
Response to 1st round of 3D rallies was phenomenal. Lot of friends on social media wrote to me about their experiences during the rallies.
Thank you Chennai for the enthusiasm during today's Bharat Vijay Rally! There is strong support for NDA in all parts of the nation.
"A vote for NDA is a vote for a new ray of hope in TN, where 2 main parties spend time destroying each other, not solving people's problems."
Need of the hour is to strengthen India's Federal Structure. PM & CMs must work together as a 'Team India' devoted to India's development.
UPA's defeat is certain. Their situation is so bad that top ministers don't want to contest polls. See how Recounting Minister ran away!
Protecting our fishermen & strengthening our fishing industry will be priority for NDA. We have seen how fishermen have suffered under UPA
NDA has emerged as an alternative in TN & emergence of this strength is in the interests of the people of TN
Tributes to Yug Purush Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary. Our great Constitution is the result of his monumental efforts
Babasaheb Ambedkar's life is journey of unmatched determination & unbreakable commitment to social justice. He inspires every Indian.
Lets reaffirm our commitment towards Babasaheb Ambedkar's ideals & work tirelessly towards creating an India that will make Babasaheb proud.
3 members of 1 family got Bharat Ratna quickly but no Congress Govt. thought of Bharat Ratna for Babasaheb Ambedkar. This speaks volumes
Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us freedom of speech but such is Congress that PM himself lost this right. Who in Cong snatched this right from him?
Political untouchability & disrespect towards institutions is the hallmark of Congress. No wonder it was a Congress PM who imposed Emergency
"Our aim is 'Apradh Mukt Rajneeti.' We need to end the atmosphere of criminalisation of politics, that was started & encouraged by Congress"
2014 Polls are about laying foundations of 21st century India. Vote for NDA & take India on the path to progress 
"A picture from the rally in Dhanbad...addressed rallies in Hazaribagh, Dumka & Dhanbad "
Congress' situation across India is so bad that we will not need CCTV cameras but high resolution cameras to find their MPs in Parliament
"Shahzada has not got over his childhood days, which is why he can't see beyond balloons & toffees. Development is a non-issue for him."
"Coming from a poor family, I never had luxury of having toffees but in last decade Guj has won several trophies for good governance!"
What commitment to democracy is Madam talking about?Did she forget how Governors were unilaterally dismissed when UPA came to power in 2004?
I am seeing a strong competition between states as to who will show the way in comprehensively uprooting Congress

"Will continue campaign in TN tomorrow with rallies in Erode, Ramanathapuram & Kanyakumari "
"Polling for 121 Lok Sabha seats, 77 seats for Odisha Assembly & 2 by-elections in WB underway. Urging voters to vote in record numbers."
Madam came to Kanyakumari & said UPA works for safety of our fishermen. I asked people if they believed her & the unanimous answer was 'No.'
Large turnout in the phases held till now shows Congress' departure is certain! Focus must now be on electing a stable & strong Govt.
I would like to congratulate 1st time voters for turning out in such large numbers. Increased turnout of women voters is commendable
"Recently Madam addressed the nation by purchasing prime time space on TV, but what she said was full of lies! "
"Madam says BJP doesn't respect institutions. Who was responsible for Emergency?There is CBI misuse, CBI-IB tension & lot more under UPA."
Youngsters should not see 2014 Polls as a poll to elect a new Govt. These polls are about the future of our youth
Netaji is 'Mulayam' where he has to be tough but is tough where he must be 'Mulayam.' This is not good for UP 
"Some are busy building Elephant Parks, some are busy on Lion Safaris & those in Delhi are least bothered. People of UP deserve better."

Here is a link to my interview with CNBC Awaaz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlEQd8B15jg&feature=youtu.be ?
Spent the day campaigning in Assam & Bihar. People's determination to punish UPA is becoming stronger day by day! 
"Instead of talking about Gujarat & me, it would be better if Assam CM devotes his attention to Assam. Congress has ruined the state."
"Shahzada should tell us about R(haul), S(onia), V(adra), P(riyanka) model. This RSVP model has looted India "

I want to congratulate @smritiirani & Karyakartas of Amethi. Ever since their campaign began Cong is worried if their leader will be elected
"We are guided by Rashtraneeti, not Rajneeti. We are committed to create an India everyone will be proud of "
Madam tells people of Amethi to take care of her son...How can a Son who cant take care of Amethi take care of the entire nation?
Urged people of Maharashtra to elect all Mahayuti candidates for a strong Government in Delhi 
"Enough of misgovernance & votebank politics. People of India want development & unity, which only NDA can provide "
"Manner in which Cong, SP & BSP are mocking my poor background shows their mindset. Yes, I am proud I sold tea...I never sold the nation"

A picture from today's rally in Kalyan 
"Great rally in Mumbai. Uddhav ji, Munde ji, Athawale ji & other leaders made a strong appeal for resounding victory of Mahayuti in 48 seats."
Our priority is to improve rail infrastructure through technology & professionalism. People of Mumbai will gain immensely from this.
"Urged my young friends- don't only be a voter, go out & become a canvasser, ask people to vote in large numbers for a strong Govt. in Delhi."
We miss Balasaheb. Lets ensure a grand victory for Mahayuti & defeat Cong-NCP. This will make Balasaheb proud 
"Dear @chetan_bhagat, many many happy returns of the day! Sharing the selfie you took last evening "
"With great happiness, the entire nation is looking towards BJP for going to people solely on the issues of good governance & development."
Petty statements by those claiming to be BJP's well wishers are deviating the campaign from the issues of development & good governance.
I disapprove any such irresponsible statement & appeal to those making them to kindly refrain from doing so.

"People of Guj have seen development in last decade & once there is NDA Govt. in Delhi, Guj's development will scale even newer heights."
Urged people of Guj to give us the opportunity to fulfil Sardar Patel's dreams of creating a strong & developed India 
Jod-tod' politics has ruined our nation. Time has come to vote for a stable Govt. that is not dependent on unhealthy politics. 
A vote for NDA is a vote for a Govt. that will lay the foundation of a Bhavya & Divya Bharat that we will be proud of 
"Urging all those voting across 117 Lok Sabha seats & Assembly by-elections in Bihar, MP & TN to vote in record numbers."
I particularly call upon my young friends to go & vote in large numbers. The youth of India must show the way!
Friends today I will file my nomination papers from Varanasi. I seek your support & blessings as I embark on this journey.
"I thank Party leadership for giving me an opportunity to contest from Varanasi, a confluence of history, culture, tradition & spirituality."
My special gratitude to all Karyakartas & well wishers who have been tirelessly working on the ground & supporting me from all over India.
"As I go to file my papers, sharing a Blog where I have penned a few thoughts about Varanasi & my journey"
Thank you Varanasi. No words will describe the affection you have showered today. Truly touched 
My coming to Varanasi is like a child going to his Mother. I have come to this divine land on the call of Ganga Mata.
I am emotionally touched & moved to see the enthusiasm& hardwork of our Karyakartas. We are very proud of you all.
I thank the policemen and security forces who were there during the entire roadshow & nomination process.
"Began the day by filing my papers in Varanasi, addressed rallies in Bihar & then spoke at a rally in Vadodara "
Fear of defeat is visible on Congress & that is why Cong is spreading lies. Madam came to Gujarat but even in land of Bapu she spread lies
"From dropout rates, debt to malnutrition in Guj, Madam tried her best to mislead people with incorrect facts. Thankfully, people are wiser"
An institution no less than CAG appreciated Guj's efforts to tackle malnutrition. Sadly Madam wants to play petty politics on serious issues
"Time & again Gujarat has reposed faith in development. This time too, it will punish anti-development & anti-Guj UPA "
"We have never seen such a weak& corrupt Govt. like UPA. Punjab should bless NDA, which will give stability & progress "
"To take a lead over nations like China we need to focus on manufacturing sector, skill development & ensure that cities like Ludhiana grow."
I want Ludhiana to become the pride of India with a shining manufacturing sector that takes lead in creating a globally known 'Brand India.'
"We are travelling across India, finding solutions to India's problems but Congress is busy finding solutions to Modi "
"I have known Jaitley ji since his student days. His intellect, integrity & commitment to progress make him a gem of a person in public life."
"We welcome Shri Daljeet Singh Kohli, Dr. Manmohan Singh's brother, into BJP. His presence will add to our strength "
"With a focus on infrastructure & cleanliness, NDA will make Amritsar a central destination for tourists & devotees from all over the world."
"NDA will focus on 5T formula (trade, tradition, talent, technology & tourism) which create a developed Amritsar "
"Congress says a tsunami destroys & Modi talks of tsunami. Yes, this is a Tsunami that will destroy corruption, price rise & misgovernance."
I want to thank friends on social media for relentlessly puncturing one lie after another spread by Congress & questioning their leaders
Recently Gujarat HC said that steps taken by Guj Govt. are in interest of people & nobody received any favours 
Affection showered by people of Varanasi remains etched in my memory. Sharing a video capturing the special moments 
Here is my latest Linkedin post where I have shared a collection of my recent interviews. Do have a look 
My condolences to Mulayam Singh Yadav ji & his family on the demise of his elder brother Ratan Singh Yadav ji. May his soul rest in peace.
"Rahul Baba says ""27,000 crore posts are vacant"" & ""2 out of 1"" children are malnourished in Guj. Only he can explain how this can happen"
"The way Rahul Baba is making statements with a dash of comedy in them, I think the TV show of Kapil Sharma may soon have to shut shop"
Addressed a rally in Srirampur in West Bengal. Here is a picture with Bappi Lahiri & @DrChandanMitra 
I have great respect for her but I wonder where did Mamata Didi's Mamata go? She put water on hopes of people & is doing just what Left did
"Mamata Didi is more concerned about her chair than people. She has to realize that she is in power now, time of Andolans are long over."
"People from Bihar, Odisha & Marwaris are not welcome for Mamata Didi but those from Bangladesh are. Time to stop such votebank politics."
Who is Mr. Chidambaram trying to protect in Sharda Chit Fund Scam? NDA assures total investigation into the scam where people were cheated.
"Successive Govts. ignored jute industry but NDA is firm on reviving the industry, just like we revived the textile sector in Gujarat."
"People of Bengal have understood that Congress, Left & Trinamool are all 1. Their misgovernance has ruined WB. NDA will bring an end to this"
"Subhas Babu said, ""Give me blood, I will give you freedom."" I told people, ""Give us support, we will give Surajya"" "
Dr. Abdullah's recent statements were hilarious. He showcased his ignorance & tried to hide how his family ruined J&K 
We are secular not because the word was added in our Constitution. Secularism is in our blood. We believe in Sarva Pantha Sambhava.
"Dr. Abdullah, in the history of our glorious culture, if there is someone who has done most harm to secularism it is you and your family."
"Just for the sake of politics, Dr. Abdullah's family communalised J&K, which is a land of Sufism and harmony "
People of Maharashtra & Gujrat share a very close bond & I hope this bond continues to grow in the years to come  
"Due to communal politics of Abdullah family, Kashmiri Pandits were removed from their homes only due to their religion. Is this secularism?"
"Instead of telling those voting for Modi to drown, Dr. Abdullah should look at himself & his family in the mirror & see how they ruined J&K"
Our path is the path of good governance & development. Irresponsible statements by the likes of Dr. Abdullah cannot derail India's mission.
Nation wants freedom from Cong's habits of dividing people. India is looking to NDA for good governance 
Touched to read of this brave act & this gesture of compassion. Makes us feel proud of our personnel in Uniform 
The nation will never forget the sacrifices of Major Mukund Varadarajan & Sepoy Vikram Singh. My condolences to the bereaved families.
"By the time campaigning ends, I would have addressed 475 mega rallies, including 196 Bharat Vijay Rallies across every part of India."
"By the end of the campaign I would have addressed 1350 3D rallies & joined Chai Pe Charcha, that was held across 4000 locations"
I came to the rally on a very sad note. I was deeply pained on how petty politics took over my tribute to Vikram Batra in HP earlier today.
There is no question of insulting our martyrs who give everything to the nation. I would rather quit politics than insult our martyrs.
"India needs a strong Government. Modi does not matter. I can go back & open a tea stall. But, the nation can't suffer anymore."
On my way to vote. I consider myself extremely blessed & fortunate to be a voter in Advani ji's Parliamentary Constituency.
Urging all those voting in 89 Lok Sabha seats across India to vote in record numbers today! Hope my young friends show the way in doing so.
Voted! Here is my selfie 
"I apologize to people of Gujarat. During the entire campaign, I spent only 18 hours campaigning in the state."
I am glad that the people of Gujarat took the campaign in their own hands & worked tirelessly for it. I congratulate them.
Selfie is in! Share yours using #SelfieWithModi & see what happens https://mosaic.narendramodi.in/  
Cong got Lalu ji released from jail but top Cong leaders are avoiding sharing stage with him in rallies. People can see through these games.
NDA will devote special attention to Seemandhra's coastline & focus on ports that will become the gateway to India & Seemandhra's progress
"Under @ncbn Hyderabad became globally known for Software industry. The same way, NDA is committing to make Seemandhra a Hardware Capital."
Hearing Pawan Kalyan makes me very happy. Here is a bright youngster who embodies the Telugu Spirit & is committed to serving people.
Congress defeat is certain. NDA is the only Alliance that can provide India a stable Govt. that can deliver progress 
Congrats to people for joining the festival of democracy in large numbers. Its gladdening to see first time voters voting in large numbers.
A picture from today's Tirupati rally 
"Greetings to people of Gujarat & Maharashtra on the foundation day of the 2 states, which started their development journey on 1st May 1960."
I pray that both Gujarat & Maharashtra scale new heights of development so that aspirations of the youth are fulfilled.
"On Gujarat Day, sharing this beautiful song by the versatile AR Rahman. Hope you enjoy it "
"After poll selfie, Narendra Modi invites supporters to send their photos for #SelfieWithModi mosaic "
Here they have explained what happens when you share your selfie using #SelfieWithModi. Do keep the selfies coming 
Offered prayers at the Tirumala Temple. I prayed to Lord Venkateswara for the peace & prosperity of our nation 
"2014 polls are a choice between those who want a Scam India & NDA, which is working hard to create a Skilled India "
My heartfelt greetings on the auspicious occasion of Parshuram Jayanti. May Lord Parshuram bless us with courage & knowledge.
"Congress, SP & BSP are fighting for the chair while we are fighting for your happiness. Divide & rule is their way, unite & progress is ours"
Cong is only bothered about power & the chair. A Mother's love is understandable but not at the cost of the nation & people's aspirations.
"PM may have spoken even 1,100 times but did he ever talk about how Sonia ji's NAC,not Planning Commission mattered more in decision making?"
India is one. NDA will not work for Hindus or Muslims but for realising the dreams of the people of India 
My colleague @naqvimukhtar campaigned in Kargil & Dras. Thankful to people for their overwhelming support to BJP 
Greetings to journalist friends on World Press Freedom Day. Free press is a democracy's cornerstone & must be preserved in letter & spirit.
"On days such as this, I feel very sad to see our National TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom."
We have witnessed the horrors of Emergency when freedom of press & freedom of expression were suppressed. It is a blot on our democracy
"Be it UP, Bihar, Uttarakhand or AP, I could see great enthusiasm among people during today's 3D rallies! Thanks to everyone who joined."
"I shared my ideas for comprehensive development of Poorvanchal, which has been neglected by SP & BSP in Lucknow & by UPA in Delhi."
Ganga's condition is worrisome. Contaminated water is a threat to children. We want to change it. Its not about politics but about humanity.
I will never forget Patna Rally. Since then I have received lot of affection from Bihar. Will return the affection with record development.
Congress is in ICU. They may get as many of their well-wishers out from jail but it wont add to their fortunes 
"Congress, Left & Didi were together in UPA but fight in WB. They are more concerned about infiltrators from Bangladesh than WB's youth."
Didi talks of real & paper tigers. A real tiger would never have protected those who have looted the poor through chit fund scams.
"Amazing rally in Asansol. Urged people to elect Babul Supriyo, a youngster devoted to serving people of Bengal "
I am sad to hear complaints of rigging & violence in parts of Bengal & UP. EC should ensure such instances don't happen in coming phases.
SP & BSP ruled UP for years. Congress is in power in Delhi but none of these parties presented their work record to the people. Shameful.
A short video capturing the enthusiasm at Allahabad rally https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Sel2xwI8k&feature=youtu.be 
I am very happy that the doors of the holy Kedarnath Temple have once again opened for pilgrims. My best wishes to the pilgrims!
"Over 6 lakh weavers lost their jobs. A package of Rs. 6,000 cr was announced but nothing reached the weavers. Its deeply distressing"
Election process has been long but people's excitement is only increasing. Direction of wind is very clear 
Amethi's untold story' -a video released at BJP Press Conference...every Indian should watch before voting 
"After addressing rallies across UP, will address a rally in Amethi in support of @smritiirani. Looking forward to the rally."
Amethi elected 3 members of 1 family over the years but what did it get? This BJP Charge Sheet tells you just that 
Thank you Amethi. Send a Lotus to Delhi from Amethi & make @smritiirani victorious by a record margin! 
I went to Amethi with a message of change. For years 1 family has ruined Amethi. I went to sow seeds of a better future for Amethi.
Congress leaders can talk about everything from Modi to the Gujarat model but have they spoken a word on what they have done for Amethi?
A leader talking about women empowerment has failed to build facilities to educate girls in his own constituency! What can be more ironical.
They looted the nation in the name of the poor but now it is the son of a poor man who is challenging them. They are not able to digest that
A vote for @smritiirani is a vote for progress. She will do for Amethi in 60 months what they never did all these yrs 
#NowFollowing @superstarrajini. Delighted to see the Superstar on Twitter. A warm welcome 
I wish my friends in the Congress who keep abusing Gujarat would have read their own Govt's report that has lauded Gujarat's development.
The Report lauds Guj's land Acquisition & Allocation model as a best practice that can be emulated by other states
"Its a pity some minds can't see beyond balloons & toffees. Today, their own Govt. has given what they call ""toffee"" yet another trophy!"
"I also call upon those voting in Assembly polls in AP & those voting in Assembly by-polls in Bihar, HP, UP & WB to vote in record numbers."
"We admired Didi for the way she fought the Left. People of Bengal expected Poriborton but nothing has changed in last 3 yrs, only Didi has."
Didi wanted Bangladeshi infiltrators removed in 2005. Now due to votebank politics she supports them. People didn't expect such Poriborton!
It is unfortunate that EC is not concerned about the institution's neutrality & that is why our Karyakartas have to embark on a Satyagraha.
I appeal to my Karyakarta sisters & brothers to maintain peace & ensure that people do not face any difficulty.
My profound apologies to Ganga Maa for not being able to perform Aarti today. Wish these people know that a Mother's love is above politics.
Joined the rally in Rohaniya & visited Party Office in Varanasi city 
I am deeply grateful to people of Varanasi for their affection 
I salute the hardwork & determination of our Karyakartas of Varanasi who are selflessly devoted to giving BJP a record win from Varanasi.
At the Rohaniya rally Col. Nizamuddin joined us. He is over 100 years old & devoted his life to the nation by joining the Azad Hind Fauj.
For me Varanasi election is not only about electing a new MP. I am here to bring a qualitative difference in lives of Varanasi's citizens.
"From tourism to giving better opportunities to Varanasi's weavers, there is lots to be done & am sure with our efforts we will succeed."
A video was shared in Rohaniya on how Sabarmati's glory is restored. We are committed to do the same with Ganga 
Kerala Minister who came to meet me was reprimanded. Cong leader wanted Lata ji's Bharat Ratna taken back.This is politics of untouchability
There are people sitting in AC rooms who say we are fatigued due to duration of polls but mood on the ground suggests otherwise.
Today I was in UP & Bihar and one has to be there at the rallies to believe the enthusiasm. People are looking to NDA as a ray of hope.
Urged all those voting in last phase to set a new record by voting in large numbers 
Concluded the campaign for 2014 Lok Sabha elections with a massive rally in Ballia in UP. I thank people for the wonderful response.

After addressing final campaign rally came to seek Atal ji's blessings. Had met him when campaign started. Its always special to meet him.
"8 months, 5800+ rallies, Charchas, programmes, 3 lakh+ KMs?an extensive, innovative & satisfying journey. My blog "
I am overwhelmed by people's response! I assure them we will repay their affection with unprecedented development.
There is something in India's soil that makes India special. Our destined role of Jagat Guru calls. Lets create a strong & developed India!
"My greetings to the nation & the scientist community on National Technology Day, marking the anniversary of the Pokhran Tests of 1998."
"Under Atal ji, India scripted a new chapter in our history & gave a strong message to the world with the success of the Tests in Pokhran."
"Today, we should think on how India can become self-sufficient in defence manufacturing. How can we strengthen R&D in defence sector."
Our Scientists are our strength and will help shape our future in this Knowledge Era with both Defence and Civilian Impact.
Today is final phase of 2014 Polls. Urging all those voting in 41 seats across 3 states & Assembly by-polls in WB to vote in large numbers.

Congratulations to the people of Seemandhra & Telangana for giving favourable results today in municipal elections for the TDP & BJP.
India has voted! Congratulations to the people of India on the successful completion of 2014 Lok Sabha elections 
Wherever I went it was a delight to interact with local people. Social media also helped me understand their sentiments.
"Due to social media, lies & false promises of several leaders could not go beyond the podiums of their rallies! More power to social media."
Today once again India has won! The power of the ballot has won & spirit of democracy has emerged supreme. My Blog 
My best wishes to @SriSri ji on his birthday. His contribution to service of humanity is immense. I pray for his long life & good health.
Held a meeting to discuss Narmada water grid distribution system & reviewed drinking water situation across Gujarat 
"On Buddha Purnima, we bow to the venerable Lord Buddha,whose teachings have guided the entire humanity for centuries "
"We pledge our commitment to world peace, non-violence & service to humankind, ideals that were very close to Lord Buddha"
"Today I launched 'Jobs in GoG', a mobile application that will be extremely handy for future generations seeking to work with the Guj Govt."
Jobs in GoG' provides all details of Govt. jobs that would be available in the coming years. You can call it a recruitment calendar!
The mobile application will be extremely beneficial to my young friends.

No words will be enough to salute the youth of India. They led from the front in the elections & rose above non-issues like caste & creed.
In a democracy there are political rivals but no enemies. People's mandate is important & together we have to work for welfare of the people

I first stepped into Varanasi as a candidate but I have become a son of this land. Maa Ganga has made me yours
When I see the pitiable condition of Ganga I feel pained but I feel it is Maa Ganga who has decided I have to do something for Her.
"Need of the hour is to restore the glory of the Ganga. Today Maa Ganga is calling us, her children to make the river clean once again."
India will become a Jagat Guru when Varanasi becomes Rashtra Guru. Lets work together to create a developed Varanasi
